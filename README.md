# 📇 Contact Manager using Python (File Handling Project)

This is a simple **Contact Management System** built using **core Python** — no external libraries or databases required. It uses a flat file (`database.txt`) to simulate database-like behavior, allowing users to **insert**, **search**, and **delete** contact entries via a CLI interface.
